<h1>Virgin Gorda</h1>
<p>Virgin Gorda is the third-largest and second most populous of the British Virgin Islands. Christopher Columbus is said to have named the island "The Fat Virgin", because the island's profile on the horizon looks like a fat woman lying on her side.
An unusual geologic formation known as "The Baths" located on the southern end of the island makes Virgin Gorda one of the BVI's major tourist destinations.</p>
